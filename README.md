*Zomato Case Study Data Analysis using MySQL*
This repository contains the code and documentation for a data analysis project on the Zomato dataset using MySQL. The project aims to explore and understand various aspects of the Zomato dataset, including:

The distribution of restaurants across various locations and cuisines
The relationship between restaurant ratings and other factors such as location, price, and cuisine
The most popular cuisines and dishes in different locations
The factors that contribute to restaurant success in terms of ratings and popularity
The project uses MySQL as the primary data analysis tool, leveraging its powerful querying capabilities and data manipulation functions. The code is written in SQL and can be executed using any MySQL-compatible database management system.

The repository contains the following files:

zomato.sql: SQL script containing the code for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis
README.md: Documentation explaining the project goals, methodology, and results
data: Folder containing the Zomato dataset in CSV format

To run the project, you will need a MySQL-compatible database management system such as MySQL Workbench or phpMyAdmin, and the Zomato dataset in CSV format. Simply import the dataset into a MySQL database, run the zomato.sql script, and explore the results using your preferred SQL client or visualization tool.

We hope that this project will provide valuable insights into the Zomato dataset and inspire further analysis and research. Please feel free to fork the repository, contribute new features or analysis, or share your feedback and suggestions with us.
